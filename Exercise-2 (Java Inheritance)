QUESTION
Write a Java program to create a class called Employee with methods called work() and getSalary(). 
Create a subclass called HRManager that overrides the work() method and adds a new method called addEmployee().
*/

class Employee{
    private int salary;
    public Employee(int salary){
        this.salary=salary;
    }
    
    public void work(){
        System.out.println("Working as an Employee");
    }
    public int getSalary(){
        return salary;
    }

class HRManager extends Employee{
    
     public HRManager(int salary){
        super(salary);
    }
    
    @Override
    public void work(){
        System.out.println("Working as an HR Manager");
    }
    
    public void addEmployee(){
        System.out.println("HR Manager is Adding new Employee");

public class MyClass{
    public static void main(String args[]){
        Employee e1=new Employee(70000);
        HRManager e2=new HRManager(75000);
        e1.work();
        System.out.println("Salary is: "+ e1.getSalary());
        e2.work();
        System.out.println("Salary is: "+ e2.getSalary());
